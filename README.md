I created this app with NextJs, TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

I fetched the data from an IMDB movie endpoint with a unique ApiKey, in order to fetch the response successfully.

I mapped through the response to create a UI for each object being pulled from the server.

I created a card with the Image, title, and so on with the data i pulled from the endpoint.

I copied a the url with the movie_id as a unqiue ID for each of the movies to display them on the dashboard, with an overview.

I had issues implementing TailwindCSS with the project, so i had to create an external CSS links to write my stylesheet.
